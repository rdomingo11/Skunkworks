Configure the Dragons Endpoint web application. Construct this endpoint from the URL that you previously saved into a file. Delete the dragons resource from the end of the URL. For example, https://abcde01234.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/dragons becomes https://abcde01234.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/.
